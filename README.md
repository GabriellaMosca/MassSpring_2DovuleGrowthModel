# MassSpringModels_ovuleGrowth2D
plugin for MorphoMechanX(http://www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX/MorphoMechanX/) to generate 2D simulations of growing and dividing ovules at cellular resolution based on masssprings.

The Git revision number these models are guarantedd to run with is: 
e618301477af8a0bda2c344a7312195ba5acf379

The Git revision number should be provided together with the request for MorphoMechanX, which is to be addressed to Richard.Smith@jic.ac.uk
Installation instructions can be requested together with the package or asked alternatively to this email address: gabriella.mosca@gmail.com 

MorphoMechanX work on Linux and the models have been tested on Linux Mint 19. 

The plugin itself does not require installation. After MorphoMechanX has been installed, to run a model 
1)move into the model directory from a terminal
2)type make run and enter.  
This will open a graphically interactive window of MorphoDynamX, and MorphoMechanX tab will be shown (Process/Model).
By double-clicking on: 
00 Ovule Master Process (Cell Ovule Growth/00 Ouvle Master Process)
the simulation will start.
